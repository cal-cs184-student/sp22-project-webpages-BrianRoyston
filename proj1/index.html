	<h3>Part 1 : Triangle Rasterization</h3>
	<p>To begin with I implemented a rudimentary rasterization algorithm using a sampling method. 
	The only method used to speed up the algorithm was a bounding box around the triangle to limit the sampling only to roughly where the triangle is. </p>
	<center>
	<img src="./images/Task1.png" style="width:960px;height:500px;">
	</center>
	<p>In order to optimize this, I attempted to implement rasterization via the Bresenham Algorithm 
		(as described <a href="http://www.sunshine2k.de/coding/java/TriangleRasterization/TriangleRasterization.html">here</a>). 
		The main idea of this algorithm is to split each triangle into a top and bottom half then use two instances of the
		 Bresenham Algorithm for line drawing in order to scan lines across the triangle to build it up. This implementation,
		  while not perfect, was successful in its main goal of optimization. Here are my results:

		difference between the two algorithms)</p>

	<p>As you can see for simpler scenes the speed-up is minor, but as the scenes get more complex 
		the effects of the optimization become more visible. In the nightmare scenario presented by
		 the last image where the triangles are especially thin and long the bounding box algorithm
		  really struggles, but the Bresenham Algorithm experiences very little slowdown compared to
		   simpler scenes. </p>
	<p>Unfortunately my implementation was not perfect. The main issue I had was with getting 
		triangles to line up properly. Something about my implementation resulted in gaps between
		 triangles at times, as can be seen in some of the images above.</p>

		<h3>Part 2 : Supersampling</h3>
	<p>The main idea for supersampling was to render to a higher resolution sample buffer and
		 downsize that to the screen by simply averaging the pixels from the sample buffer. The 
		 purpose of supersampling is to solve the problems with aliasing and jaggies that come 
		 with the standard triangle rasterizer. The only modifications to the rasterization 
		 pipelines involved changing the rasterizer to modify the sample buffer, and adding a 
		 new step which averages the sample buffer in order to scale it down to the screen size.
		  Running this with the triangle rasterization code from before I got the results below. </p>

	<div class="container">
		<p><b>4 Samples Per Pixel</b></p>
		<img src="./images/Task2_2_SS4_cropped.png" width="650px" />	
	</div>

	<div class="container">

	</div>

	</center>
	<p>The higher sample counts smooth out the jagged edges found in the particularly sharp 
		triangles. This is because the downsizing at the end of supersampling effectively cuts 
		out high frequency changes from the image. These high frequency changes, like the harsh
		 edge of a triangle can cause aliasing and other artifacts. By supersampling we filter 
		 out these high frequencies and leave only the smooth low frequencies. </p>
	<h3>Part 3 : Transforms</h3>
	<p>That was a lot of words, here is a hand standing cube man made using transforms to control 
		his body and limbs using a hierarchical structure. </p>
	<center>
	<img src="./images/Task3.png" style="width:480px;">
	</center>

	<h3>Part 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
	<p>Barycentric Coordinates are a way to represent a point's position within a triangle.
		 The three values of the coordinate essentially store the weights of each triangle 
		 vertex. In order to calculate the cartesian coordinates, you simply take the weighted
		  average of the three vertices using these weights. </p>
		  <center>
			<img src="./images/BarycentricExample.png" style="width:960px;;">
			</center>	  
	<p>In this example the weight for the left vertex is encoded as red, the closer to the corner
		 a point gets, the more red that pixel will be. Likewise the top and right vertices are 
		 encoded as blue, and green respectively. The center of the triangle is gray, because it
		  has equal distance to all 3 vertices.</p>

	<p>These coordinates can be used to map textures to the triangle faces like I will show in the next section, 
		or it can be used in the same way as this example to make larger gradients such as this. </p>

			<h3>Part 5: Pixel Sampling</h3>
			<p>In this task I implemented texture mapping. To do this I sampled each pixel to get itâ€™s barycentric coordinates and used those
				 to look up the corresponding color in a texture file. A question arises however when that texture look up does not land exactly
				  on the center of a pixel. There are two common answers to this question. One is to simply find the closest pixel to the sample 
				  point and use that color entirely. This is called nearest sampling. This can cause the resulting image to look pixelated because 
				  there is a harsh cutoff from one pixel to the next. The other option is to take a weighted average of the nearby pixels. This solution 
				  is called bilinear sampling. This approach is great when we want to avoid the pixelated look caused by nearest sampling. Here are some
				   examples of the two methods:</p>
			
	<div class="container">
		<p><b>Nearest Pixel Sampling, 1 Sample Per Pixel</b></p>
		<img src="./images/Task5_Nearest_SS1.png" width="650px" />	
	</div>
	
	<div class="container">
		<p><b>Nearest Pixel Sampling, 16 Samples Per Pixel</b></p>
		<img src="./images/Task5_Nearest_SS16.png" width="650px" />	
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<p><b>Bilinear Pixel Sampling, 1 Sample Per Pixel</b></p>
		<img src="./images/Task5_Bilin_SS1.png" width="650px" />	
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<p><b>Bilinear Pixel Sampling, 16 Sample Per Pixel</b></p>
		<img src="./images/Task5_Bilin_SS16.png" width="650px" />	
	</div>		
			
			<p>There will be the largest difference between nearest and bilinear sampling when there are a lot of high frequency changes in the image.
				 Bilinear sampling serves a similar purpose to super sampling, but with reduced costs. It manages to blur out some of the high frequencies
				  from the image to make it more pleasant on the eye. </p>
			
			
			<h3>Part 6: Level Sampling</h3>
			
			<p>Sometimes, a texture image is actually too high resolution for the size of triangle we are trying to draw it on. This can cause aliasing because 
				the high resolution can create high frequency changes, which are not good. The solution to this problem is to create multiple levels of image 
				resolution for the texture called mipmaps. </p>
			
			<p>Level sampling adds another tool to our arsenal to fight the high frequencies of our image. Level sampling, pixel sampling, and super sampling 
				each have their own pros and cons. Super sampling is incredibly versatile. It can solve both the jaggedness of edges for triangles, and the
				 aliasing problems of image textures. Unfortunately, super sampling is incredibly slow. In order to supersample, the image must first be rendered
				  at a higher resolution, drastically increasing the time to render a frame. Pixel and level sampling are a lot more efficient, as they do not require
				   a high resolution render to work. Level sampling does sacrifice memory usage for the sake of runtime, having to store several levels of detail for each
				    texture used in a project. And neither method can help with aliasing problems arising from geometry, only textures.</p>
			
			<p>Here are some images showcasing the effects of level and pixel sampling. In order to better show the effects of the sampling methods, the image has been 
				shrunk down to create some aliasing artifacts, especially around the fork.</p>
