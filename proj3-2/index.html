		<h3>Part 1 : Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
		<p>In this section I implemented reflection and refraction.
		</p>
		<center>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 0</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_1_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>At depth 0, the only thing visible is the light itself. This is no different from the first part of this project.</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 1</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_2_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>At depth 1, we start to see the direct reflections of the light off the surface off the two spheres.</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 2</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_3_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>Now the walls are visible in the reflections. Notice how the refraction is still not visible. This is because both 
				the entering and exiting of the sphere count as collisions. So at depth 2, it doesn't have another bounce 
				left for that light to actually hit something.
			</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 3</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_4_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>The refraction is now visible. Also, the parts of the scene like the ceiling which are not directly illuminated 
				by the light are now visible in the reflection. The reflection of the glass sphere is still incomplete however.
			</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 4</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_5_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>The glass sphere can now be seen in the reflection. In addition, caustic effects can now be seen with the sphere 
				focusing light onto the wall.

			</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 5</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_6_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Ray Depth: 100</p>
				<img src="images/Part1_7_high.png"/>
			</div>
			<p>This change is more subtle. The biggest change is with the effects of internal reflection in the sphere. 
				The top of the glass sphere now has a bright spot that is created by the focusing of light as it bounces around 
				inside the sphere.
			</p>
		</center>

		<h3>Part 2 : Microfacet Materials</h3>
		<p>Sometimes the interaction of light with a surface is very dependent on the small details in the surface. For example, a rough
			metal materials depend a lot on the roughness of the surface. To account for this, we add a parameter alpha, to represent 
			surface roughness.
		</p>
		<center>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Alpha: 0.005</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_1.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Alpha: 0.05</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_2.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Alpha: 0.25</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_3.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Alpha: 0.5</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_4.png"/>
			</div>
		</center>
		<p>As alpha increases the material starts to act more and more diffuse, as the area the light reflects across gets closer 
			to a full hemisphere.
		</p>
		<p>To start with we only have a function to determine the probability of a light having bounced in a specific direction.
			If we reverse this function we can create a way to sample the bounce based on the actual likelihood of that bounce. 
			This importance sampling, much like with direct illumination, creates a much less noisy image with the material.
		</p>
		<center>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Hemisphere Sampling</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_5.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Importance Sampling</p>
				<img src="images/Part2_6.png"/>
			</div>
		</center>
		
		<p>This process can be used to model physically accurate materials. In this example I created a material based on
			the physical parameters of iron. In reality the reflection of light is the result of light sampled at every wavelength.
			However, in this case we are able to just deal with how the material effects red (614 nm), green (549 nm) and blue (466 nm) light. 
			This is stored in the Vector3D parameter eta.
