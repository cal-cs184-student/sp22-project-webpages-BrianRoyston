		<h1>CS 184 Project 3-1</h1>
		<p>Note: all renders have been done using 12 threads at a resolution of 480 X 360</p>
		<h3>Part 1 : Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h3>
		<p>In order to start ray tracing, we need rays. So to start out with I implemented a ray generation algorithm that would take in the x, y coordinates in screen space and turn those into rays in world
			space based on the camera's fov. This involved translating the screen coordinates into camera space based on the fov, and then converting from camera space to world space based on the camera's 
			position and rotation in the scene.</p>
		<p>Now that we have rays, we need a way to detect when they intersect with the scene. There are two primitive objects I implemented in this section. The first was a simple triangle intersection algorithm.
			The process of this was done similarly to project 1, but now in 3 dimensions. Since the barycentric coordinates would be essential after the collision anyway, I used the efficient barycentric coordinate
			calculation we learned in class and checked if those coordinates corresponded to a position inside the triangle. After implementing this I was able to render scenes with normal based shading.

		<p>The other primitive I implemented was sphere intersection. This process was similar to the triangle intersection but now we are solving the equation for a sphere. This part led to some troubles down the line
			because a ray will likely intersect the sphere twice and it is important to return the correct intersection. If you do not, it can cause interesting behavior when calculating lighting later on. After 
			implementing this I was able to render spheres.

		<h3>Part 2 : Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h3>
		<p>The naive approach to checking for ray collisions involves checking the ray against every triangle in the scene. This approach gets very slow as the number of triangles increases. Luckily there are several 
			approaches to speed this up. The one I implemented in this part is called bounding volume hierarchy. The idea of this is very similar to that of a binary tree. We create a large bounding  box around every 
			triangle in the scene. Then split the set of triangles in half based on some heuristic and create a smaller bounding box around that set. This process continues, until the set of triangles in the "leaf" nodes 
			of this binary tree are small enough. To check for ray collisions, all you need to do is check for collisions with the top bounding box. If it collides you then can check it's two children, and repeat all the way 
			until a leaf node where you can check the triangles.

		</center>
		<p>The choice of heuristic is a complicated one. For this project I went with this approach: Find axis with the widest range (furthest distance between min and 
			max position), then split the set of triangles around the midpoint of that axis. This heuristic is not perfect when it comes to efficiency, but it still provides a significant speedup.</p>

		</center>
		<p>As you can see the speedup for BVH is incredible. This comes down to one simple factor, the runtime of the naive approach scales linearly with the number of triangles, while the runtime of
			the BVH approach scales roughly with the log of the number of triangles. The result of this is massive speedups with a large numbers of triangles. Without BVH the rest of this project would be nearly impossible
			to complete in a way that wouldn't take hours to render.
		</p>
		<p>Here are two photos that would be nearly impossible to render with the naive approach, likely taking several minutes each. But with the BVH both of these scenes can be rendered in about 0.06s</p>

		<h3>Part 3 : Direct Illumination</h3>
		<p>In this approach I implemented two approaches for direct illumination. The first, more naive, approach was uniform hemisphere sampling. The way this works is that is that for each pixel a ray is shot out,
			upon collision we need calculate the lighting at that point. In order to do that with hemisphere sampling we shoot out several rays from that point in random directions (in a hemisphere aligned with the 
			normal of the object). We then check each of those rays to see if it hit a light. There is a fatal flaw in this approach however. In many scenes, in most directions there are no lights. So most of the rays shot
			out serve absolutely no function other than to waste computation. This is where importance sampling comes in. With this approach we only sample in places where there is likely going to be a light. So for each light
			in the scene we sample rays directly towards it, and check for collisions on the way to know whether or not the point is in shadow. This results in a much less noisy image.

		<p>To compare the effect of the number of light samples let's look at this scene with multiple values.</p>
		<center>
			<p>Importance Sampling | Pixel Samples: 16</p>
			<div class="container" >
				<p>Light Samples: 1</p>
				<img src="images/part3_6.png"/>
				<p>1.4689s</p>

				<p>47.0429s</p>
			</div>
		</center>
		<p>As you can see, when using importance sampling the areas fully illuminated, or fully in shadow converge on the correct value very quickly. However points that are only partially illuminated by the light, like 
			the penumbra of the shadow appear very noisy at low levels of light sampling. This is because there is a random chance of the ray being cast either hitting the light or not because the light source is partially
			occluded. So more rays are needed for this value to converge correctly.
		</p>
		<p>Another advantage importance sampling can give us is point lights. In the hemisphere sampling scheme point lights are essentially useless. The odds of a random ray intersecting with a specific point are 
			essentially 0. However with importance sampling we sample the point light directly. This allows us to render scenes like this.

		<h3>Part 4 : Global Illumination</h3>
		<p>Direct lighting is nice to calculate shadows but it is not perfect. In the real world light bounces. If an object is held close to a red wall, it will have a bit of red light shining on it that 
			bounced off the wall. The goal of global illumination is to simulate this kind of behavior with light. In order to achieve this each point we sample needs to shoot out another ray to simulate a bounce of light.
			That ray then simulates another bounce and so on until we reach a maximum ray depth. For the sake of runtime there is also a random chance that any ray will stop before reaching the maximum depth,
			 this approach is called russian roulette.
		</p>
		<p>Here is a scene rendered using just direct illumination like before:</p>
		<div class="container" >
			<img src="images/part4_1.png"/>
			<p></p>
		</div>
		<p>And this is just the global illumination for this scene. </p>
		<div class="container" >
			<img src="images/part4_2.png"/>
			<p></p>
		</div>
		<p>As you can see the bottom of the bunny is well lit because of light bouncing off the floor, and the sides are lit based on the color of the nearby walls.
			Interestingly the top of the bunny is actually the darkest part despite it being closest to the light. The reason for this is that there aren't many things indirectly shining on the top. The main source would be 
			the roof, but the roof is not as well lit as the floor so in this case where we only look at indirect illumination, the bottom of the bunny receives more light.</p>

		<p>Note: for the sake of time some of these images have been rendered using the adaptive sampling from the next section. This does not change the clarity of the images, but explains the non linear 
			scaling of the runtime for the 1024 sample render
		</p>



		<h3>Part 5 : Adaptive Sampling</h3>
		<p>Not every pixel takes as long to compute as every other pixel. If a pixel is in a bright, flat area with few objects around it, it will converge much quicker than an area in shadow or very close to complicated
			geometry. To account for this I implemented adaptive sampling. The main idea of adaptive sampling is to keep track of the distribution of values you are getting for each pixel. By calculating the standard deviation
			we can determine how much the pixel has converged to it's proper value. Once this convergence gets close enough we can stop sampling. Here is a scene rendered with adaptive sampling. On the right is a heatmap 
			showing how many samples each pixel took.
		</p>
		<p>Pixel Samples: 2048 | Light Samples: 1 | Max Ray Depth : 5</p>

		<div class="container" >
			<img src="images/part5_2_rate.png"/>
			<p></p>
		</div>
		<p>Red corresponds to pixels that took a long time to converge, while blue pixels converged quicker. As you can see the background and the flat parts of the base farther away from the dragon were the quickest
			to converge. The part of the base in shadow and near the dragon took slightly longer to converge because those regions are much more impacted by bounce lighting off of the dragon. There is a lot of red inside
			the dragons mouth, and in the nooks and crannies of the model. This is because these areas involve a lot of bounce lighting to calculate correctly. Finally another interesting thing to note is that the outline
			of the whole model has a thin layer of red. This has to do with anti-aliasing. Since individual rays within a pixel on the boundary may or may not hit the object, it takes longer for the render to converge on 
			those pixels as it needs to figure out how much of the pixel is covered by the mesh.
